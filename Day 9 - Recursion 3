Objective
Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial
factorial(N)={1                 N<=1
              Nxfactorial(N-1)  otherwise

Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

factorial has the following paramter:

    int n: an integer

Returns

    int: the factorial of n

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format

A single integer, n (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints
    2<=n<=12
    Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

Sample Input

3

Sample Output

6

Explanation

Consider the following steps. After the recursive calls from step 1 to 3, results are accumulated from step 3 to 1.
1. factorial(3) = 3 x factorial(2) = 3x2 = 6
2. factorial(2) = 2 x factorial(1) = 2x1 = 2
3. factorial(1) = 1

Solution in Python 3:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the factorial function below.
def factorial(n):
    '''Function to calculate the factorial'''
    if n < 0:
        return -1
    elif n<2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    n = int(input())

    result = factorial(n)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
