Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in

n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Example
n=125
The binary representation of 125 base 10 is 1111101 base 2. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

Input Format

A single integer, n.

Constraints
1<=n<=10power6

Output Format

Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.

Sample Input 1

5

Sample Output 1

1

Sample Input 2

13

Sample Output 2

2

Explanation

Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of 5base10 is 101base2, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 13base10 is 1101base2, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.

Solution in Python3:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



n = int(input())
DATA = bin(n)        
MAXIMUM = 0
CURRENT = 0
    
for num in DATA:
    if num == '1':
        CURRENT = CURRENT + 1
    else:
        MAXIMUM = max(MAXIMUM, CURRENT)
        CURRENT = 0
print(max(MAXIMUM, CURRENT))
