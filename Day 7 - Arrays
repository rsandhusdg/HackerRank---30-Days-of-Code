Objective
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Example
A = [1,2,3,4]

Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N(the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.

Constraints
1<=N<=1000
1<=A[i]<=10000, where A[i] is the ith integer in the array.

Output Format

Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Sample Input

4
1 4 3 2

Sample Output

2 3 4 1

Solurion in Python 3:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())

    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    m=map(str,arr[::-1])
    print(" ".join(m))
    
Sample Test case 0:

Input (stdin)

    4

    1 4 3 2

Your Output (stdout)

    2 3 4 1

Expected Output

    2 3 4 1
